## Abstract
This mobile-forward application is an interactive retro pokemon game. Pokemon Masters may often become bored and need a way to sharpen their pokemon identifying skills. (Never know when you will seen them in the wild!!).

The user has the capabilities to play a game of "Who's that pokemon?" and view all 151 pokemon (generation 1) through a pokedex.


## Learning Goals
- Understand and implement React Hooks
- Reinforce React fundamentals
- Reinforce using React Router to create a multi-page user experience
- Reinforce component and asynchronous JS testing

### Wins
- Finishing our MVP 
- A captivating retro user interface
- Creating an engaging game with sounds and scores
- Successfully utilizing React Hooks

### Challenges 
- Testing external react-select Npm package
- Testing a randomized function from within our app component
- Implementing audio to play on load

### Future Iterations..
- Viewing all favorites on the same screen
- Battle mode: have two pokemon go into battle
- Utilize React Context for more robust data manipulation, rather than between sibling components
